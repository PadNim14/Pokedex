## Introduction
For this project, I have created a Pokedex using React and its Material UI Library along with the Poke API as a regular attendee of Software Saturdays held by
Purdue University's IEEE chapter. This Pokedex was the culmination of the Final Project by Software Saturdays and meets the Advanced ReactJS 
certification awarded by the Purdue College of Engineering.

## What is a Pokedex?
It's essentially a vast encyclopedia that contains all the information of various Pokemons in the game, which includes information like height, weight, base XP, 
and any other attributes associated with that Pokemon. For more information, you can read the history and the development of Pokedex here: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex

## My Pokedex!!!!
Here's a link to my Pokedex: https://padnim14.github.io/pokedex/
My Pokedex has the basic info of height, weight, and Base XP for all Pokemons. 
In addition, I have added the "Level Up" sound effect when you press the button "More Pokemon!" by using the 
UiFx library from React. This program was partially inspired by the Software Saturdays' chair, Hadi Ahmed, and 
the mentors of this session.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
